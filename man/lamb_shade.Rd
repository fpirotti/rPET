\title{Calculate Lambert Shading Map}
\usage{
lamb_shade(
  heightmap,
  sunaltitude = 45,
  sunangle = 315,
  zscale = 1,
  zero_negative = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{heightmap}{A two-dimensional matrix, where each entry in the matrix is the elevation at that point. All points are assumed to be evenly spaced.}

\item{sunaltitude}{Default \code{45}. The azimuth angle as measured from the horizon from which the light originates.}

\item{sunangle}{Default \code{315} (NW). The angle around the matrix from which the light originates.}

\item{zscale}{Default \code{1}. The ratio between the x and y spacing (which are assumed to be equal) and the z axis.}

\item{zero_negative}{Default \code{TRUE}. Zeros out all values below 0 (corresponding to surfaces facing away from the light source).}
}
\value{
Matrix of light intensities at each point.
}
\description{
Calculates local shadow map for a elevation matrix by calculating the dot
product between light direction and the surface normal vector at that point. Each point's
intensity is proportional to the cosine of the normal vector.
